# Display Mutator

A simpler interface to the NVIDA X Server Settings.  Note that neither the author, nor this software are affiliated with NVIDIA.

Allows certain config values to be changed, without opening a GUI app, adjusting sliders, and clicking buttons.

Values in the script were chosen:

 - to make the display look less washed out,
 - with the author's particular graphics card and monitor, and
 - in the author's particular software environment.

## Could this script useful for me?

It is unlikely you even have the problem that this script solves.  So, probably, no.  At least not in its exact current form.

## What advantage does this script have, compared to just making persistent changes to `.nvidia-settings-rc` directly?

1. It was an excuse to write a script.
2. It will allow a set of different, convienently accessible presets of display settings to be set up and switched between in future, if desired.
